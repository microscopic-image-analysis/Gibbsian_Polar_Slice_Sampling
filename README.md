## Gibbsian Polar Slice Sampling

This repository contains the experiments and plots presented in the paper

Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning,  
PMLR 202:30204-30223, 2023

Each experiment is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook. These notebooks
contain not only the source code specific to each experiment but also a
definition of the target distribution under consideration, as well as some
explanations regarding the target's properties, the overall purpose of the
experiment and the means by which we analyze the samplers' performances. For
context regarding the samplers themselves, we refer to the paper, available
on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03945.pdf) and in the [conference
proceedings](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schar23a/schar23a.pdf).

Thanks to the
[CRC1456 LiveDocs initiative](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/665057.html),
various ways to interactively run the experiment notebooks as well as a Docker
container of them are provided under the following links:
